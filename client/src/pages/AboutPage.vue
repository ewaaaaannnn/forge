          consumers
          and
          local
          businesses.
          Consumers can post
          their specific business needs—whether it's a repair job, a service, or a custom request—and businesses can
          respond
          in the comments with tailored offers, pricing, or availability. On the flip side, businesses can showcase
          their
          services and special offers, making it easier for consumers to discover and connect with the right
          providers.
